        <h3>Our Vision and Mission</h3>
        <p>VOrskin's concern for animals is manifested by its Cruelty Free claims on its products. We believe that conducting experiments on animals is not necessary. The beauty industry today has many alternatives to ensure that products remain safe without conducting animal experiments. Our entire team are beauty enthusiasts, before releasing products to the public, we try all products first<br><br>
            VOrskin's commitment to nature conservation and care for the earth is manifested in every product. VOrskin only uses natural ingredients that are harmless to the environment and of course provide benefits for the skin. In addition, Avoskin uses glass packaging that can be recycled more easily. This reduces plastic and other waste.
            VOrskin is committed to continuously making improvements in terms of composition to our commitment to supporting the green beauty concept. In 2020, VOrskin is committed to reformulating and presenting several products with a clean beauty concept. This clean beauty concept includes the selection of product raw materials to the packaging used. Avoskin focuses more on the quality of its products through clean and more eco-friendly ingredients. In terms of packaging, Avoskin uses eco-friendly plastic with sustainable materials derived from sugar cane, one of them.<br><br>
            In terms of composition, VOrskin is committed to presenting products with minimal ingredients that are alcohol free, SLS free, paraben free, fragrance free, silicone free and no animal testing. The natural extracts in VOrskin products also come from various parts of the world and are picked manually by local farmers in the morning to maintain their quality.</p>
